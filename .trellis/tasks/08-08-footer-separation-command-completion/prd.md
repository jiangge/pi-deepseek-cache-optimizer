# Improve footer separation, command completion, and audit hardening

## Goal

Make Pi Cache Optimizer's footer status visually distinct when other extensions also publish footer statuses, make `/cache-optimizer` easier to use with native Pi Tab completion, resolve the confirmed audit findings, and replace the shared v6 stats file with a process-safe v7 shard store so independently running parent/child Pi sessions can contribute truthful cache statistics without overwriting one another.

## What I already know

* The extension publishes its status through `ctx.ui.setStatus("pi-cache-stats", statusText)` in `index.ts`.
* `formatCacheStats()` currently starts with the adapter label, so Pi can render another extension's status immediately before it without a visual separator (for example, `Cloudflare MCP: off OpenAI cache ...`).
* Pi's registered-command API supports `getArgumentCompletions(argumentPrefix)`, which is the native completion hook used by the interactive editor.
* `/cache-optimizer` currently parses subcommands including `enable`, `disable`, `doctor`, `stats`, `config footer-mode total|session|process`, `compat`, `reset`, and `fix`.
* The project requires runtime behavior, README, spec, and permanent regression tests to stay aligned.

## Requirements

* Prefix the extension-owned footer status with `· ` so that the combined footer reads like `Cloudflare MCP: off · OpenAI cache 0/0 · 0M/0M tok`.
* Keep the existing internal separators and warning markers intact; the prefix must be applied consistently for normal, disabled, router-restored, integrity-warning, and compat-warning footer variants.
* Add native `/cache-optimizer` argument Tab completion using `getArgumentCompletions`.
* Complete all supported top-level subcommands: `enable`, `disable`, `doctor`, `stats`, `config`, `compat`, `reset`, and `fix`.
* Complete the nested `config footer-mode` path and its supported values: `total`, `session`, and `process`.
* Filter suggestions by the currently typed argument prefix, tolerate leading/trailing whitespace, and return `null` when there are no matches so Pi can fall back normally.
* Do not change command execution semantics or introduce a custom editor/autocomplete provider when the native command completion hook is sufficient.
* Update English/Chinese README examples and the footer contract spec to document the leading separator and command completion behavior.
* Preserve the pre-existing `models.json` access mode exactly across `/fix` backup, commit, self-check failure, and rollback; do not independently tighten or loosen it.
* Use unique non-overwriting backup names and atomic temp+rename for both commit and rollback.
* Detect explicit unsupported `prompt_cache_retention` errors from response headers or finalized assistant error messages so subsequent current-process requests strip the rejected field.
* Type-check against the installed official Pi and Node declarations instead of a full ambient module redeclaration.
* Run every permanent `tests/*.test.ts` file and migrate critical persistence, routing, hook, TTL, lifecycle, and model-identity contracts out of archived-only verifiers.
* Require Pi 0.82+ in package peer metadata, matching the documented support range.
* Reuse the direct command handler for interactive menu actions so security-sensitive `/fix` and other command behavior have one implementation path.
* Replace the shared `pi-cache-optimizer-stats.json` writer with a v7 shard directory where each extension instance atomically writes only its own UUID-named shard.
* Delete and ignore old v1-v6 stats files instead of migrating them; upgrading intentionally restarts local footer statistics from zero and does not affect upstream provider caches.
* Aggregate shards by exact `${provider}/${modelId}` only. `session` combines shards with the current hashed session id, `total` combines all valid local shards for the current day, and `process` reads only the current extension instance.
* Make `session` the default footer mode while preserving explicit persisted config and environment overrides.
* Use global/model reset epochs so enable/disable and `/reset` invalidate older shards without modifying files owned by other processes or allowing reset resurrection.
* Refresh TUI totals through `fs.watch` plus lifecycle/command refreshes; do not install a permanent polling interval.
* Clean expired shards and temp files under a cross-process cleanup lease. Keep every current-day shard even after its writer exits; remove eligible old shards after the retention period without following symlinks.
* Make `/cache-optimizer stats` show detailed per-model statistics for the current session only. Make `stats all` show detailed per-model totals across all valid local sessions, including request and token summaries such as `4/5·0.66M/0.83M 78.7%`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* [x] Every non-empty status published by this extension begins with `· `, including disabled-mode and warning-suffixed statuses.
* [x] A footer containing another extension's status renders with an unambiguous separator before this extension's model/cache label.
* [x] `/cache-optimizer <Tab>` offers the supported subcommands.
* [x] `/cache-optimizer c<Tab>` narrows to `config` and `/cache-optimizer config <Tab>` offers `footer-mode`.
* [x] `/cache-optimizer config footer-mode <Tab>` offers `total`, `session`, and `process`, filtered by prefix.
* [x] Invalid/unknown completion prefixes return `null` without throwing.
* [x] Regression tests cover the footer prefix and completion filtering/nesting.
* [x] `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run check:diff`, and `npm run check:pack` pass.
* [x] README.md, README.zh-CN.md, and `.trellis/spec/frontend/cache-adapter-footer-stats.md` match the implemented behavior.
* [x] Direct and menu `/fix` paths preserve modes such as `0600` and `0644`; forced post-write failure atomically restores both original bytes and mode.
* [x] Two backup names generated in the same millisecond are distinct and existing backups are never overwritten.
* [x] A body-only assistant error `400 Unsupported parameter: prompt_cache_retention` makes the next request omit that field.
* [x] Standard `npm run typecheck` uses the installed Pi 0.84.3 declarations and passes without `types/pi-coding-agent.d.ts` or Node module redeclarations.
* [x] Permanent tests cover migrations, `_nosession` removal, serialized writes, shutdown flush, routing/cache-hints, TTL ordering, cache key preservation, and direct-provider identity consolidation.
* [x] `peerDependencies` requires Pi 0.82+ and interactive menu actions reuse the direct command handler.
* [x] Parent, child, parallel, and independently running Pi instances write distinct atomic v7 shard files and never overwrite one another.
* [x] The old v6 and pre-rename stats files are ignored and best-effort deleted; no old counters are imported.
* [x] Default footer mode is `session`; explicit config/env `total|session|process` behavior remains authoritative.
* [x] `session`, `total`, and `process` select the correct shard scope and never merge different provider/model keys.
* [x] Model/global epoch changes prevent old shards from resurrecting reset statistics.
* [x] Current-day closed/dead-process shards remain available; expired old shards/temp files are safely removed under one cleanup lease without following symlinks.
* [x] TUI shard refresh is event/lifecycle driven and installs no permanent polling interval.
* [x] `/cache-optimizer stats` reports all current-session models in detail; `stats all` reports all local current-day models with request/token totals and percentages.

## Definition of Done

* Runtime code and official Pi API type usage are updated.
* Permanent tests cover the externally visible footer/completion contracts, confirmed audit hardening contracts, shard isolation/aggregation/reset/cleanup, and current-session/all-session command output.
* `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run check:diff`, `npm run check:pack`, and task context validation pass.
* User-facing documentation and the relevant Trellis spec are synchronized.
* All required quality checks pass and the final diff contains no whitespace errors.

## Technical Approach

* Add a small pure completion helper in `index.ts` that returns Pi-compatible `{ value, label, description? }` items for the supported command grammar, including `stats all` and `stats contributors`.
* Model persisted runtime stats as immutable ownership shards plus global/model epoch markers; keep parsing, aggregation, output formatting, and cleanup helpers pure enough for deterministic permanent tests.
* Register that helper as `getArgumentCompletions` on the existing `cache-optimizer` command.
* Add the leading `· ` at the final footer status assembly boundary rather than changing adapter labels or `/cache-optimizer stats` output.
* Consume Pi's installed native command-completion and context types directly; remove the full local ambient Pi/Node redeclarations that can mask API incompatibilities.
* Export the pure helpers through `__internals_for_tests` only as needed for deterministic tests.

## Decision (ADR-lite)

**Context**: Pi combines status values from multiple extensions in one footer line. The extension's current status has no ownership boundary, and its command has several nested arguments that are easy to mistype.

**Decision**: Use the conventional middle-dot prefix (`· `) at the beginning of this extension's status and Pi's built-in `getArgumentCompletions` API for command completion. Provide completion for the full supported command grammar without changing command parsing.

**Consequences**: The footer gains one visible leading separator while preserving existing status wording. Completion remains native to Pi and requires no extra UI dependency. Future subcommands need to be added to the same completion grammar when command support changes.

## Out of Scope

* Reliably labelling another session as a child/subagent without an upstream parent-child protocol; command output uses current/other contributing sessions instead.
* Collecting statistics from child agents that do not load this extension, use a different Pi agent directory, run remotely, or expose no cache usage.
* Migrating old v6 counters into the shard store.
* Permanent low-frequency TUI polling; watcher misses are repaired by lifecycle and explicit-command refreshes.
* Replacing Pi's footer renderer or taking ownership of the whole footer.
* Adding completion for unrelated built-in commands or file paths.
* Changing cache statistics formatting, counters, warning semantics, or command behavior.
* Adding fuzzy matching beyond the prefix filtering expected by Pi's completion API.

## Technical Notes

* Primary runtime file: `index.ts`.
* Official Pi types: installed `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` declarations.
* Command/footer/fix tests live in `tests/review-findings.test.ts`; broader runtime contracts live in `tests/runtime-contracts.test.ts`.
* Relevant spec: `.trellis/spec/frontend/cache-adapter-footer-stats.md`.
